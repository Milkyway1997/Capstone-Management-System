For Miami University, my team and I designed and built a capstone-projects allocation system 
that allowed faculties to post projects on the website and students to form groups among themselves. 
After students have teamed up and bid on projects in groups, 
our bidding algorithm will allocate a distinct task to each team.

Here are some screenshots of the system:
